With the release of Veeam Backup & Replication version 10 [around the corner](https://go.veeam.com/v10), it's only fitting that we get some added goodness with a new version of the [Veeam Plugin for vCloud Director](https://github.com/VeeamHub/veeam-plugin-for-vcd). I'm happy to announce that a new version of the plugin is available today!

New features of the plugin include:

* Single Sign-On (SSO) capability
* Support for Veeam Backup & Replication version 10
* Support for VMware vCloud Director 10

[Documentation for deployment & configuration of this plugin can be found here.](https://veeamhub.github.io/veeam-plugin-for-vcd/)

_Note: This new plugin does not change the Architecture & Design of the Veeam Self Service Portal. It serves only as a medium to easily present the Self Service Portal within vCD._

If you have any questions/problems/feature requests about the plugin, please use the projects [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/VeeamHub/veeam-plugin-for-vcd/issues/new/choose).
