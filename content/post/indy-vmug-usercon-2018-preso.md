I'm really looking forward to presenting at the UserCon today. I'm especially excited as vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) is a tool that I think a lot of companies could leverage to start their automation journey. If anyone has any follow-up questions after the presentation, please feel free to reach out to me via Twitter or Email.

As promised, you can download the slides from my presentation [here]({{< siteurl >}}/Simplifying_vSphere_Automation_with_vRealize_Orchestrator.pptx).
